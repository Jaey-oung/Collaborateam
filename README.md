<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<p>Although it was an individual project conducted over one and a half months, the aim was to develop a user-friendly website to facilitate team building and management. Through this journey, I could understand the process of connecting the frontend and backend. During the development, there were many challenges due to the lack of knowledge. Adopting the user's perspective leads the logic of each functionality well and brings the project to success.</p>
<p>Utilizing the Spring framework directly experience the benefits of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Dependency Injection (DI), and Inversion of Control (IoC) which minimize duplicate code and maximize reusability. I feel that I have taken a significant step forward in my development skills, and it has also presented an opportunity to recognize my areas for improvement. For my next project, I would like to participate in a team project to gain experience in collaborative development and to explore the use of CI/CD tools.</p>
